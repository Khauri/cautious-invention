# Chronicle Core

These are core packages for Chronicle including various zod schema and configurations.

## Framework Support

In order to support a framework, Chronicle requires the framework to implement, in the framework's component language, a `Block` component.

This ultimately allows you to compose components together into new blocks with a drag-and-drop interface.
