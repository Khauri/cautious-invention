# Chronicle/Client

Design inspired by Histoire, Notion, Builder io, and Figma

A "story-based" documentation system. Unlike Storybook and Histoire, stories and documents are created from within this client application as opposed to mdx or story files.

The backend is most typically an instance of `@chronicle/server`, but can be anything that conforms to the same trpc contract.

## Features
- [ ] Write a "story" using a notion-like interface. [editorjs](https://editorjs.io/) is the best choice so far
- [ ] Create drag-and-drop blocks and layouts
- [ ] Automatically infers the project type
- [ ] Export blocks and layouts to code
- [ ] Add arbitrary API functionality
- [ ] Design system integration
